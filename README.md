# yabai-skhd-config

Tiling window manager and hotkey daemon setup for macOS

## Setup Guide for Yabai and Skhd

This guide will walk you through the process of downloading, installing, and configuring `yabai` and `skhd` on macOS using two different methods.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Option 01: One-Click Setup via Nix

This method uses [Nix](https://nixos.org) and the included `flake.nix` to automate the installation and configuration of `yabai` and `skhd`.

### Requirements

- [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download.html)
- Flakes enabled (add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`)

### Steps

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/DinethDilhara/yabai-skhd-config.git
cd yabai-skhd-config

# Run the setup script
nix run
```

### What this does

- Installs `yabai` and `skhd` using Homebrew (if not already installed)
- Copies your `skhdrc` and `yabairc` config files into `~/.config/`
- Restarts both services using `brew services`
-  You're good to go!
